*********** FOR CALEB -> REFLECTION FOR THE SPRINT *************
- We didn't stick to our trello board backlog as much as we planned to.
- Keeping a communal change log was a brilliant idea and super helpful/useful. That way, we didn't
have to backtrack.
- We(sley) learned a lot about file systems and interactions with threads.
- We gained a better understanding of loose-coupling and while it was a large amount of code
re-writing, it helped our program out in the end and will make future changes easier to implement.
- We found that we did not need an interface for every entity class, we really only needed one
interface for the entities.
- Giving us feedback on our minutes early was very helpful for both the team morale and future
planning in minutes.
- ADD MORE?

    RatedRelation:
        - Everything in this interface was made this sprint
        - Note: RefArg is the only class that implements this interface
    Relation:
        - Everything in this interface was made this sprint
        - Note: RefIdea and RefArg are the only classes that implent this interface

    -- Created the Relatable interface.
    Relatable:
        - Everything added in this interface
        - References, Ideas, and Arguments implement this interface

Entity Classes:
    Argument:
        - Wrote an equals method.
        - Removed the registerRelation and removeRelation methods.
        - Added a default constructor.
    Idea:
        - Wrote an equals method.
        - Added a default constructor.

    Library:

        - Added generateCitation methods but they are not fully implemented.
        - Added

    Theme:
        - Wrote the equals method.
        - Added a default constructor.

    Topic:
        - Wrote the equals method.
        - Removed the registerRelation and removeRelation methods.
        - Changed getChildren to getEntityChildren.
        - Changed addTheme to registerChild.
        - Changed deleteTheme to removeChild.

    Other Comments:
        Removed the add method from all entity classes, now they all inherit
        registerChild and createChild from Editable. This is also true of the remove methods,
        they now all implement removeChild.
        - Added a default constructor.
        - Removed each class's child list and moved it to Editable
        - Added a default constructor to all Entity Classes.
        - Removed all getEntityChildren methods was added to Editable superclass
        - Add to all entity classes a createChild class
        - Implemented listOptions and listAttributes in all entity classes
        - getFunc was added to every entity class
        - listOptions was added to every class
Management:
    RefMeisterExec:
        - Rewrote main()
        - Supports specifying directory via command-line

XML:
    MalformedXMLException:
        - Thrown when an XML file is malformed

    Saveable:

    XMLManager:
        - Changes in tag order to use the looser coupled interfaces in grouping tags.

        - Changed to use a factory for creating entities and relations
        - Removed the saveLibrary method, moved to FileManager
        - Made loadLibrary not static, requires an instance to attempt to load a string

    FileManager:
        - Created
        - Singleton with an alternate thread designed to allow the controller to not
          stall while saving
        - Locks implemented to prevent a library from being accessed mid-edit.

        - Added code to allow errors to have a severity.
        - Added lock to error logging to allow for errors to be logged.
