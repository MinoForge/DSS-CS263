    Other Comments:
        Removed the add method from all entity classes, now they all inherit
        registerChild and createChild from Editable. This is also true of the remove methods,

        - Removed each class's child list and moved it to Editable
        - Added a default constructor to all Entity Classes.
        - Removed all getEntityChildren methods was added to Editable superclass
        - Add to all entity classes a createChild class
        - Implemented listOptions and listAttributes in all entity classes
        - getFunc was added to every entity class
        - listOptions was added to every class
Management:
    RefMeisterExec:
