#How to Run

Run the program through the GUIDisplay Class.
Once opened, the program brings up a title screen to begin. You may either
a demo (stored in refmeister_saved/default.rl) or create a new library from scratch.
The GUI Refmeister version automatically saves to an autosave file every 30 seconds in a background thread.
Additionally, the runtime log can be found in the refmeister.log file.
